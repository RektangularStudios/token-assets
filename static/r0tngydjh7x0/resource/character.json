  "description": "The Draculi prowl beyond the Garden of Residues' waters. Their superior brethren roam the land afar. Accumulated en masse, they writhe during the scout for flesh. Birthed with a rare, fiery genetic mutation, the Alpha Draculi glorify the taste of blood. Their preference for a slow death is evident, often by prolonging the bloodletting of victims within their tightened jaws."
