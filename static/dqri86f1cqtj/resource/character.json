  "description": "These stalkers wander Aphantasia, capturing humans to breed and sell on an underground market. A stun remote is used to immobilize humans, who are then brought to somewhere inexplicable and unknown. Presumably, travelling in numbers won't stop them. Many well-sized crowds have gone missing in or near Aphantasia."
