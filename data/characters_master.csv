Though punishable with death, renegade Grevan operators often delve into them, hoping to discover some new talent. They leave a residue as they float, which evokes visions in those who dare make contact.","I enter a mysterious mansion. Around it are empty homes and tents, frozen in time as if the inhabitants had been whisked away. The communal dining hall has wooden pitchers, nearly empty of blueish tea. The liquid left acidic burns around the edges of tiny cups aligned nicely to the seats of a long table.

That same shade of blue floats about the mansion basement. Spherical forms glow with symbols of wealth. They shy away when I reach for them, trying to touch them. Are they solid?

Their swirling trails hang in the air, giving me flashbacks of their memories when I walk through them. Visions eerily similar to the picturesque, abandoned village.

Not long ago, it seems a mysterious man arrived. Their thoughts are fixated on his whereabouts. Oddly, they can't remember what he looked like.",,,2021-05-12T14:00:00-08:00,,sia://PAFIkGTYhJrCzUFNxfSkIMF_nfoeI9M1myRk2_3ZO3p1cQ,sia://AADz5maASFMkF0Pn4xsRvnwEWMdkThRzqGzRmMq519a6Gw,sia://DAC0wCeCbkh7Rz2EZKr7A2XyqLiu9lXDkZsuSvrmjk8-Zg,sia://AADZ3VYVgJUBS3lwLdGPPaO6GTJy-_TZgGvtgLL55uHetA,sia://AACG819Y6AmMRxrrVTWfugSZCGMSZTM9MJr05buVNTOrrQ,sia://AABIATywB4GOmny5PVmDY2GMih74X576Zs5SWborkMCGEA,sia://CACV_7zHFXR61lvFshzz8WCxOWW0nhs8JIanrVsHu5GdIA
